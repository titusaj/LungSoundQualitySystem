% Lung Sound Quality System
% Matlab Implemention that need to be converted to C++

%This code is meant to measure the snr of the signal in realtime

% Input
% the audio buffer is input into this system currently for processing (this
% buffer can be of varying lengths

%Output
% The SNR value and boolean value indicating if the the sound is to loud


function [SNR, qualityValue] = lungSoundQualityCheck(audioBuffer, Fs)
